Build a fully automated, safe, production-ready SEO content SaaS platform that connects to WordPress and Shopify. The system should include subscription plans, admin control, tiered feature access, and future-proof modular architecture. It should:

1. Multi-Site Connection & Scan

Connect to WordPress via REST API (wp-json/wp/v2/posts) using OAuth or Application Passwords.

Connect to Shopify via Admin API (Articles API for blogs) using private app credentials or OAuth.

Crawl connected sites safely (respect robots.txt) to extract URLs, titles, headings, metadata, internal links, and current keywords.

Provide a visual topic map per connected site.

Allow multiple site connections per account, with site-specific settings.

2. Subscription Plans & Feature Access

Free Plan: limited to 1 site, 1 post/day, basic keyword suggestions, and limited AI content generation.

Paid Plans: configurable (e.g., $X/month), allow multiple sites, multiple posts/day, advanced keyword API integration, AI image generation, SEO analysis, internal linking suggestions, semi-automated backlink outreach.

Feature access must be controlled by plan, with the ability to upgrade/downgrade.

Include payment integration for subscription (Stripe/PayPal).

3. Keyword Discovery & Management

Suggest keywords using:

Seed keywords from the connected site(s)

Paid/free Keyword APIs (Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz)

Score keywords: search volume, difficulty, relevance, competitor gap.

Manual keyword pinning and custom keyword addition.

Store all keyword metrics in DB.

Feature access gated by plan:

Free plan: basic keyword suggestions (limited queries/day)

Paid plan: unlimited queries, competitor gap analysis, long-tail keywords.

4. Content Generation & Images

Generate SEO-optimized posts per keyword:

Title, meta title, meta description, headings (H1/H2/H3), body content, conclusion, internal links.

Include LSI keywords automatically.

Generate AI images (hero + inline) using OpenAI DALL·E, Stability AI, or MidJourney; assign alt text automatically.

SEO quality checks: readability (Flesch-Kincaid), duplicate content/plagiarism (optional Copyscape), meta tags, alt tags.

Plan-based access:

Free plan: AI text only, no images.

Paid plan: AI text + images + advanced SEO checks.

5. Publishing Engine

WordPress: create posts (draft/publish), upload media via REST API.

Shopify: create articles via Admin API with images, tags, and categories.

Schedule posts via queue management (Celery / RQ / Bull).

Suggest internal links to previously published posts.

Plan-based limits: number of posts/day controlled by subscription tier.

6. Backlink Helper (Safe & White-hat)

Identify niche-relevant prospects (blogs, resource pages).

Generate semi-automated email outreach sequences for guest posts, resource pages, or expert link requests.

Track responses, manually confirm backlinks, and log status.

Paid plans get full backlink helper features; free plan may only view prospects or track manual outreach.

7. Admin Dashboard & Control

Global Admin (you) can see all user accounts, connected sites, subscription status, usage, generated posts, and keyword metrics.

Can create/modify subscription plans, enable/disable features, and view analytics.

Users see only their account, sites, and allowed features based on plan.

8. User Dashboard

Connect sites (WordPress/Shopify), manage keywords, view content queue, approve/generated posts, schedule posts, and track backlink prospects.

View usage limits and plan details.

Upgrade/downgrade plan via payment integration.

9. Analytics & SEO Tracking

Track keyword rankings, post performance, traffic metrics via Google Analytics / Search Console.

Feed data back into keyword prioritization for smarter content suggestions.

10. Technology Stack

Frontend: React or Vue (responsive, dashboard UI).

Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express).

Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for users, sites, keywords, posts, subscriptions.

Queue: Celery / RQ / Bull for heavy tasks (content generation, image generation).

Storage: S3-compatible (images/media).

APIs: WordPress REST API, Shopify Admin API, Keyword APIs, OpenAI GPT (text), OpenAI DALL·E/Stability (images), optional Copyscape/plagiarism.

Payment: Stripe / PayPal for subscriptions.

11. Automation Rules & Safety

Human-in-the-loop approval optional but recommended for content quality.

Only auto-link internally; no automated external links.
